    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>IPv6Gen is a privacy-focused tool. The core functionality of this website (generating IPv6 addresses) happens entirely within your web browser using JavaScript. No data you type into the generator is ever sent to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to understand how our site is used. To protect your privacy, we have configured GA4 with the following safeguards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IP Anonymization:</strong> Your full IP address is never stored.</li>
        <li><strong>No Advertising Tracking:</strong> We have disabled Google Signals and Ad Personalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Strict Referrer Policy:</strong> We do not send full URL information to external sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>Google Analytics may use cookies to distinguish unique users. You can block these cookies using your browser settings or a privacy extension without affecting the functionality of this site.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Hosting</h2>
    <p>This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect basic server logs (such as IP addresses and timestamps) for security and operational purposes as part of their standard hosting service.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, you can reach out via the contact information in our security.txt or via the GitHub repository.</p>
